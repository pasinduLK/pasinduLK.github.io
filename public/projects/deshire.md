## Overview:

**Tools Used:** Adobe XD  

**Deshire** is a minimalist, design-driven platform created to streamline the connection between graphic designers and clients. The name itself — a blend of “Designer” and “Hire” — captures the essence of the project

This single-page UI concept is all about **clarity, balance, and usability**, crafted with a modern aesthetic to highlight content without overwhelming the user. I focused on a layout that feels effortless to explore, with consistent spacing and clean typography that enhances readability and visual flow.
