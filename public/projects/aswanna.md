## Agriculture Platform â€“ Article Section

This agriculture platform was built as a group project to support farmers by providing knowledge on modern agricultural technologies and techniques. The platform aims to keep farmers updated and educated through digital tools.

---


### My Contribution

I was responsible for designing and developing the **Article** section of the platform. This section was divided into two main parts:
- **Author Section**
- **User Section**

---

#### Author Section

- Add new posts using a **rich text editor**, enabling styled and visually appealing content.
- Delete existing posts.
- View a list of all added posts for easy management.

#### User Section

- Display a list of published blog posts.
- Allow users to view full articles in a **clean, responsive layout**.
- Enable **emoji-style reactions** to posts for user engagement.
- Reactions are stored in the user's browser and synced with the backend to update counts in real time.
- A **spam reaction blocking mechanism** was implemented to prevent misuse.
