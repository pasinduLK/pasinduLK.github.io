## Overview:

As a self-initiated project, I redesigned YouTube Musicâ€™s homepage and few components to enhance usability, navigation, and content organization. My goal was to create a more intuitive experience while maintaining YouTubeâ€™s design language.

---

## Problem Statement:

YouTube Musicâ€™s homepage can feel cluttered, and its content organization lacks clear categorization. Additionally, the player and search experience could be more seamless.

## Wireframing & Prototyping:

Using Adobe XD, I created wireframes to visualize my ideas for the new layout. The mini player design was created to be small but functional, allowing users to access essential controls easily.
